# Proyecto-Final-Curso-SQL-Coderhouse
F1 Race Results database based on every Grand Prix on the F1 calendar.
The database was made on MySQL Workbench and it was prepared just for basic SQL querys and to properly know how to handle relevant data for example: "Amount of race points based on positions" and to know how to deal with Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.
We've decided not to put any historical data of 'Pilotos', 'Equipos' and 'Temporadas' because our goal is to record just one Season of the Formula 1 Championship, but it could record any season.
Here are the SQL scripts that I've made for my Final Project of the SQL Course of Coderhouse.
